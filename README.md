# Sentimental Versioning

## Version One dot Oh, Erm...

### by Dominic Tarr

Some version number systems aspire to merely label changes
in an interface, but there is much in the human experience
that lies outside of this. Sometimes a version is just a number,
but sometimes what we really want is  a _poem_.

Semver has a spec, but Sentimental Versioning has not a spec,
but a guide; just some whimsical suggestions.
If you use sentimental versioning you *should not* copy another
sentimental versioning system. You *should* do something creative and original.
You *may* explain the system you create, if the beauty is enhanced by understanding it.
You _may_ just improvise new numbers from your mood
on that day. The only important thing, is that the version
number *must* be meaningful to you, the author.

Interpreting the previous paragraph according to the specific meanings
defined in [RFC2119](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2119.html)
 for _“should”_, _“should not”_, _“may”_, and _“must”_ is entirely _optional_.

# Inspiration

Following are some projects that use sentimental versioning.
Draw inspiration from the way their version numbers
express intangible aspects of the project, and are a work of art on their own.

## Node.js
### by Ryan Dahl

node.js is like a rebellious teenager. It skips class
and plays in a punk rock band - yet still gets straight A’s.
ts versioning system expresses its dual nature
beautifully. Version numbers alternate between even and odd,
and between stable and unstable. In unstable versions
node makes its own rules and sticks it to the man. In stable
versions node wears a long sleeve shirt over its tattoos
and works at fortune 500 companies (fighting the system from
the inside?). Some critics say that node is part of the
establishment now, citing that it’s been a very long time
since its last album was released, version `0.12` having
been in the works for over a year. While this accusation
may carry some weight, you cannot put a time frame on
creativity, and you must admit that node’s use of sentimental
versioning is a beautiful expression of its own internal conflicts.

## Backbone
### by Jeremy Ashkenas

Jeremy calls his versioning system
[romantic](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2888#issuecomment-29076249)
(which is _very sentimental_ of him)
It looks like semver (`major.minor.patch`), but with
a personal meaning. For him, a patch is a change you
probably won’t notice, and a minor change is when you
change it a little bit. A major change is when you make
a major release (notice the circular definition!).
A major change can be anything or nothing. He says
every change _should_ be backwards compatible. But what
does “backwards compatible” mean to Jeremy? That is
up to you to decide. Jeremy’s use of sentimental versioning
expresses how backbone is his masterpiece, and he, its master.

## TeX and Metafont
### by Donald Knuth

In his seminal text layout system, TeX, and his equally
brilliant typeface design system, METAFONT, Donald uses
a versioning number system that asymptotically approaches
perfection. The version numbers of TeX approach π 
(the current version is `3.14159265`) and the version numbers of
METAFONT approach `e`. It has been prophesied that the
last change not be made until after the day Donald ascends
to heaven on a shining cloud. At that point, Donald will
make one last ssh connection down from heaven to his server at
Stanford University and set the version number unto π 
_exactly_. At that point all remaining bugs will be declared
features, and the output from TeX will remain the same
for all eternity.

## Ruby
### by Yukihiro Matsumoto

Ruby also likes the looks of SemVer. However they also wanted to
add their [own flavor to the game](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/12/21/ruby-version-policy-changes-with-2-1-0/).
Why should only MAJOR be allowed to release breaking changes? MINOR
should get their slice of that cake as well. Also minor versions are like
presents, so they are released every Christmas. Major versions on the other
hand are only reserved for really special events (more special than Christmas).

# Realization

What ever happens, not everyone will understand your intentions,
possibly your genius will not be recognized within your lifetime.
But we did not choose the life of the artist for fame and certainly
not for fortune - But rather, a dedication to aesthetic beauty and
self expression.

In this spirit, go forth, and create _beautiful versions!_.
